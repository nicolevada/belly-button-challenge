# Interactive Web Visualizations

This project demonstrates the use of D3 library to create interactive web visualizations. It includes a bar chart, a bubble chart, and the display of sample metadata. The data is loaded from a JSON file and the charts are dynamically updated based on user selection.


## Features

- Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) for each individual. The sample values are used as the values for the bar chart, the OTU IDs are used as the labels, and the OTU labels are shown as hovertext.

- Bubble Chart: Shows each sample with OTU IDs on the x-axis, sample values on the y-axis, and marker size representing the sample values. The marker colors correspond to the OTU IDs, and the OTU labels are displayed as text values.

- Sample Metadata: Displays the demographic information for each individual. The key-value pairs from the metadata JSON object are shown on the page.

- Dropdown Menu: Allows the user to select a specific sample, which updates all the plots and displays the corresponding sample metadata.
